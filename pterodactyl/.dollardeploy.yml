  Pterodactyl is a modern, secure, and scalable game server anagement platform. 
  Built with PHP, React, and Go, it isolates each game server in its own Docker container
  to maximize security and stability. The web-based interface provides real-time
  WebSocket consoles, role-based user access, a robust API, and SFTP file management.
  Designed for both hobbyists and enterprises, it supports Minecraft, CS:GO, Rust, ARK, and more.
